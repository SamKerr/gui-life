## gui-life

This was the final assignment of the Cambridge University Object Oriented Programming course.

This is an implementation of [Conways Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in Java, using Swing for the GUI.

This project was a good chance to demonstrate my understanding of the principles of OOP.
